# SVG Logo Maker CL App

* Our homework this unit was to create a Command Line App that creates simple [svg] file logos based on a number of prmopts. The practice I got using classes and class methods was really helpful, and using multiple JS files with module exports is really helpful for cleanliness. We also used the jest package to create a testing suite for each of those classes to make sure they work as intended.
